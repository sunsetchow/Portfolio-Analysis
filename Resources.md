### Key Concepts to Master

#### Investment Policy Statement (IPS)
- **Objectives:** Risk tolerance, return requirements
- **Constraints:** Liquidity, time horizon, taxes, legal, unique needs

#### Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA)
- Long-term target weights based on client objectives
- Empirical studies show 85-95% of portfolio returns come from SAA decisions

#### Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)
- Short-term deviations from SAA based on market views
- Must set limits in IPS for deviation ranges

#### Optimization Frameworks
- **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)** — Classic Markowitz approach
- **Black-Litterman Model** — Combines market equilibrium with investor views
- **Risk Parity** — Equal risk contribution from each asset class
- **Core-Satellite** — Index core + active satellite positions

#### Risk Budgeting
- Allocate risk across sources of return
- Optimal when ratio of excess return to marginal risk is equal across assets

#### Rebalancing Approaches
- **Calendar-based** — Fixed intervals (quarterly, annually)
- **Range-based** — Trigger when weights drift beyond thresholds
